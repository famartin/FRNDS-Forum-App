# FRNDS-Forum-App
A communication app using Node JS, passport js, socket.io, express and mongoose. I also used various other npm packages.
My goal for this application was to make it easy for a small group of friends to stay in touch privately. Users are able to have their
own accounts and post messages that other users can comment on. Users are also able to go to a chat room and communicate real time
with anyone inside at the same time. If you want to contact someone directly, you can send a private message to another user.

You are able to see every post individually in more detail. If you are the user who posted it, you are able to remove it.

I chose to keep the design very minimal as I think it shines light on the conversations.
